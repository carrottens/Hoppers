# Hoppers
This is the first Java project that I programmed in my 1st year of university (2020).
The aim was to create a game in Java using the Swing APIs and given graphic resources.

The goal of the game is to be left only with one (red) frog by making frogs jump over each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in this way making the frog, which is jumped over, disappear.
