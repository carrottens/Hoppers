# Hoppers
The second coursework of the first year of university.
The aim of the CW was to create a game in Java using the Swing APIs and given graphic resources.
***
The goal of the game is to be left only with one frog by making frogs jump over each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in this way making the frog, which is jumped over, disappear.
***
Disclaimer:
The game no longer runs because the graphic resources (images) are missing as I do not own them.
